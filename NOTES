The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default

For string values the ORDER BY keyword will order alphabetically:


ORDER BY Several Columns

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;

This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:


SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND(CustomerName LIKE 'G%' ORCustomerName LIKE 'R%');

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'A%';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID NOT BETWEEN 10 AND. 60;


SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT CustomerID > 50;


SELECT SUM(Quantity * 10)
FROM OrderDetails; 

Return all customers starting with either "b", "s", or "p":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '[bsp]%';

Return all customers starting with "a", "b", "c", "d", "e" or "f":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '[a-f]%';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. 

SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01'AND '1996-07-31';
